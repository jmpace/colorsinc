# Socket-Color

## Colorsinc allows everyone to share a moment together.

You and I visit the same websites and read the same news, but we never experience a moment concurrently. Colorsinc changes the solitary experiences we have online to shared ones.Instead of asynchronous voyeurism, the internet is a universal event which unites us all.

Colorsinc uses a synchronous web technology to send an identical sequence of colors to all visitors at the exact same moment no matter where you are in the world.Mindful togetherness through technology.
